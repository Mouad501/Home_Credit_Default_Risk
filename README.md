# Home Credit Default Risk (KAGGLE COMPETITION)

This project is an end-to-end case study that gave me a taste of a real world data science problem, how you just start with a business problem and end up having insights that lead to a better decision making.

## BUSINESS PROBLEM

Loans have always been an important part of peopleâ€™s lives for quite some time now. Each individual has different reasons for borrowing a loan. It could be to buy a dream car or a home, to set up a business, or to buy some products. Even wealthy people prefer taking loans overspending their cash so as to get tax benefits and to keep the cash available for future unexpected and unconventional expenses.

Loans are also as important to Lenders as they are for Borrowers. Almost all Banking Organizations make most of their revenues from the interests generated through loans. However, the caveat here is that the lenders make a profit only if the loan gets repaid. The Lending Organizations are faced with the tough task of analyzing the risk associated with each client. Therefore, it is important to identify the risky behaviors of clients and make educated decisions.

The business problem that we are looking into is given a loan application of a client at Home Credit, can we predict if the client will be able to repay the loan or not.

## SUMMARY

In this PROJECT of blogs, i will build an end to end Machine Learning Case Study for predicting the Defaulting Risk associated with a borrower. The series consists of 3 parts:

1. Introduction and Exploratory Data Analysis : HOME_CREDIT_DEFAULT_RISK_EDA.ipynb 

2. Feature Engineering : Home_Credit_Feature_Engineering.ipynb

3. Feature Selection and Machine Learning Modelling : Home_Credit_Feature_Selection_and_modeling.ipynb
